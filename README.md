# Alloy-Project

This project uses a React frontend and Flask backend to build an application form for Gotham Capital. The form details are submitted to Alloy via API request and a response is returned to Approve, Deny, or Manual Review the customer.

Instructions to get going:
- API token and secret are not included in this project. Please set up a .env file with token valid token and secret
- Use flask to start the backend server from terminal `flask run`
- Use NPM to start the frontend client from terminal `npm start`
  - You may want to first run `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` to assure there isn't an incompatability between your Node.js version and other Webpack features

From here you should be able to test away! Enjoy
